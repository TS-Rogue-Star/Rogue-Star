The minerals are most notable along its head, back end, and feet, where they are not contained by skin or flesh. The top of its head is adorned in a crown of several sharp horns, and what might otherwise be considered a tail, is a large outcropping of these same crystals. Of note, this creature lacks any feet in the traditional sense, instead having something resembling hooves, but made out of that same crystal. These creatures seem to have a method of chipping and sharpening their hooves, so they are each quite dangerous! With its high mineral diet, this creature has a highly specialized multi compartment digestive tract, and it seems quite capable of and willing to scrap for mineral based meals both processed and otherwise. These creatures are considered a nuisance, as they have a tendency to nibble wires and at the edges of structures, and upon some technology."

When it detects a potential prey item, it rushes them down, using its flat body to pounce upon them, and pin them to the ground, where it is free to bite them, and draw blood out. Once again, it has enough wisdom to not drain prey dry, usually trying to leave them alive so that they can be fed upon again in the future. This behavior does not extend to groups of these creatures however, as together, a group may drain someone dry in a matter of moments!
