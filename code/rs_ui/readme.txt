Additional Attribution Terms for Rogue Star UI (AGPL § 7 (b)-(c))

Preservation of visible credit

Any part of the Program that, in the un-modified version, displays the text “Rogue Star UI” or “RS-UI” must continue to display a substantially similar credit.  If you redesign that element, place the same credit in an About dialog or settings screen reachable in no more than two user actions.

Preservation of source-file headers

Every source file that carries a copyright or attribution header referencing “Rogue Star UI”, “RS-UI”, or the original authors must retain that header (you may update years, add your own notice below it, or re-format comments, but the original attribution text and copyright holder(s) must remain legible).

Modified versions
If you convey a modified version, add “(modified)” after the credit or otherwise mark the interface so users know it is not the original.
